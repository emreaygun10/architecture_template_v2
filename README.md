# architecture_template

I have developed a modular and testable Flutter template utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This template is designed to enhance maintainability and scalability of Flutter applications by promoting clean separation of concerns and testability. The foundation of this template is based on the resources provided at [GitHub - VB10](https://github.com/VB10), which offer a solid reference for implementing modular architecture and best practices in Flutter development.
